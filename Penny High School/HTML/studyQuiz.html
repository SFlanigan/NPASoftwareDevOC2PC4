<!- The reveal graphic contains an inline JavaScript event which reveals the advice below –>
<img class="reveal" src="../images/reveal.png" onClick="document.getElementById('reveal2').style.display='block'">  
<p id="reveal2" class="hidden"> A good night's sleep will help your ability to concentrate in class and during revision.  Recent scientific studies have shown that the light emitted from TV, tablet and phone screens confuses our brains into thinking it's daytime.  If this is the last thing you do before you try and sleep you may find it harder to nod off.</p>


<p> Q3 - How many days before a test do you start revising? </p>
 
<!- The reveal graphic contains an inline JavaScript event which reveals the advice below –>
<img class="reveal" src="../images/reveal.png" onClick="document.getElementById('reveal3').style.display='block'">  
<p id="reveal3" class="hidden"> Constantly reinforcing your knowledge will have a significantly greater effect on your progress than a last minute cram before an exam.  Ensure you study regularly and do not leave revision until the last moment.</p>
