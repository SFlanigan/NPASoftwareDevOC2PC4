<h2>The Importance of Study</h2>
<p>Studying outside of the classroom is as important as the work you complete in class.  It allows you to consolidate what you have learned and understand any weakness you may have in your knowledge or skills.  Study groups offer you the additional time required to address these weaknesses through peer discussion or extended one-to-one time with a member of staff, often not possible in a classroom.</p>
